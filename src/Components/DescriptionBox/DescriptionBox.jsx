        <p>The Navitimer is one of the most recognizable watches ever made. It’s on collectors’ lists of the greatest watches of all time. What began in 1952 as a tool for pilots has gone on to mean something profound to every single person who has had this timepiece along on their personal journey. Our icon now comes in 36 and 32 mm sizes for women and men who love the look and feel of a smaller diameter watch. While the 36-mm Navitimer features the beaded bezel and iconic circular slide rule that gives the Navitimer its unmistakable appearance, the dazzling 32 mm variation forgoes the slide rule in favor of a simplified dial design suited to its slim diameter. But these showstoppers have so much more to offer than just their trim new sizes. Pops of pastel, mother of pearl, and traceable precious materials combine with subtle refinements to give the timepieces a jewelry-like appeal—adding a versatile elegance to the legendary navigational watch that’s ready for wherever the journey takes you.</p>
